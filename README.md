# UFO Finder
#### By Omie Roosevelt

## Overview:

The purpose of this demonstration is to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time of UFO sightings as shown below.

## Results
As you can see at the bottom of the screen you're able to narrow your search based on date, city, state, country and shape.
The image shows an example of all UFO sightings reported in the state of "fl". The filters have a placeholder already in place to give users an idea of what information they should input during their search. Once you have typed the desired information, simply hit "Enter" button on your keyboard to begin your search.

## Summary
One drawback from this webpage is the the lack of a "Filter" button. Some users may not be as tech savy as most and not realize they would have to hit the "Enter" button on their keyboard. As a user, regardless of your technilogical background, there should always be accessibility.

For further development, I recommend the allowable input value should be expanded. This will give the user the capability of filtering the search with ease and less of running into empty data. I also would recommend a drop down list in the filter criteria. As we all know, users do not read our minds when we develop webpages, therefore they will run into frustrations if they continously enter the incorrect search criteria and receive no information in return. Aesthetically, the webpage looks fantastic, but I would prefer something more user friendly.
